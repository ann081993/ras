This repository includes the scripts and source data for
* Collecting information on phytochemicals
* Extracting biological activity results
* Determining biological test outcomes (the decision algorithm)
* Aggregating chemical similarity and BTOs
* Training random forest-based nuclear receptor activity classifier
* Building single-cell transcriptomics-based linear regression model
